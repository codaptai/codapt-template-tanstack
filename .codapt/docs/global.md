This is a full-stack TypeScript application. We use:

- TanStack Router
- React
- tRPC
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind
- Zod
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Zustand & Zustand Persist middleware

Whenever possible, try to break up large pages/components into smaller components in their own files.

When storing data like auth tokens, we should use Zustand Persist.

You can import from `src/...` with the alias `~/...`.
